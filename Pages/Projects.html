      <h1 class="subtitle2">October 2025</h1>
      <p class="essay2">This project is a wearable meade using an ESP32 with various sensors attached. Sensor data like heart rate and movement are sent to an LLM using a REST API and a backend, which then gets sends the feedback back to the wearable ESP32. We intended to have it show up on a screen, but didn't have one at the time of the creation of this.</p>

      <p class="essay2">I was part of UTD's FSAE team before transferring, and there I helped start the Data Acquisition System for the first electric competition car. I was in charge of choosing which sensors to use and integrating them. We used both analog and I2C sensors, and these were routed to a Pi Pico to each wheel, and each of those were connected to the central microcontroller. </p>

      <p class="essay2">This was a Pi Zero powered device that used a PAJ7620 motion sensor to record hand motion and send commands to a phone hooked up to another speaker or car stereo to skip/rewind songs or pick up/decline calls. This was done via BlueZ in Python using AVRCP (Audio Video Remote Control Protocol).</p>

  <p class="essay2">This app allows uses object detection to track a basketball and a rim, alloing users to visualize their training sessions and gauge their shooting efficiency over time. It even offers a friend system that uses Firebase, where users can send each other friend requests and view each other's stats and recent training sessions. The app's logic was the easy part: it was definitely making the model that took me the longest.</p>

      <p class="essay2">ShelterSafe was intended to be an app where organizations like the Red Cross and federal government could add temporary shelters to a map in case of disaster, as temporary shelters aren't often listed online. Although I wasn't able to complete it, the experience was integral to my next app, Swish Lab, listed below.</p>

      <p class="essay2">This project was very brief and simple, but it was the first time I was able to use my skills for something that helped with a real life issue. My high school's Key Club used Google Forms for attendance, which was inefficient. I made a system that could use an ID scanner to record attendance in a CSV file to easily track attendance.</p>

This was my first computer science experience, and even though the final game only takes about 15 minutes to complete, making it presented quite the challenge and it was a great learning experience.</p>
